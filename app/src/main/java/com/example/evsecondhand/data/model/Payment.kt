// Payment.kt was deprecated and its model types moved into `Wallet.kt` and `Checkout.kt`.
// This file is intentionally left minimal to avoid duplicate-type declarations during
// a transitional refactor. Remove this file entirely once callers have been updated
// and after verifying the project builds.
